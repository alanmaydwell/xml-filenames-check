# xml-filenames-check
Simple python script that checks whether filenames listed in xml files are actually present in the directory.

Place **filename_list_check.py** in the directory you want to check and run it. Prints results to console.
Only works if all files are in the same directory.

The two xml files are just for example purposes.
